mpv is a media player, designed to be configured from the command line instead of via a GUI interface. An mpv window only contains the video, and the "OSC" (on screen controller), there are no menus for loading videos, or changing settings.

mpv can play video and audio, either from local files or from network streams. It includes integration with `yt-dlp`, to allow playback of YouTube videos.

As mpv is highly configurable, it is often used in scripts, for example a simple music player can be made by mapping a hotkey to `mpv ~/Music/somePlaylist`. Unix sockets can be used to communicate with a running mpv instance, allowing control of the playback without focusing the window (you need not even have a window open).

## mpv.conf

`~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` is used for general configuration. Details about some useful/interesting options are listed below:

| Set Default Window Size to 30%         | `geometry=30%`                        | By default videos will open at their true size. This makes them smaller so they don't take over the entire screen                                                 |
| Save Video Progress                    | `save-position-on-quit`               | Video will reopen at the point you left off (unless `--no-resume-playback` used)                                                                                  |

## input.conf

`~/.config/mpv/input.conf` is used to set keybinds for mpv. My keybinds are listed below (not all of these are in `input.conf`, as some are the default):

### Video Navigation

| Decrease speed by `0.1` | `d`      | Use negative number to decrease speed (`add speed -0.1`) |
| Reset Speed             | `r`      |                                                          |

The speed control keybinds are the same as [Video Speed Controller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/videospeed/), a popular addon to control HTML video playback
