# About

This website is designed as a wiki type resource for my own coding projects, as well as for topics I have learned. It's a completely static website with minimal JavaScript. I write the content for the website in Markdown files which are then converted to HTML using a Golang program whenever I push to the GitHub repository.  
Eventually I want to build a proper Markdown compiler in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/). [Why?](projects/future.md#odin-markdown)

## Contributing

If you spot a problem in the Wiki, or something can be improved/expanded upon, feel free to submit an issue or pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/randomcoder67/randomcoder67.github.io).

## CSS

The current CSS can be found at [https://www.randomcoder67.github.io/style.css](/style.css). Changes to the CSS can be seen in the GitHub repository

## Contact

You can email me at [randomcoder67@gmail.com](mailto:randomcoder67@gmail.com)  
If you find an error/bug, or simply have a question about any of my programs/GitHub repos, it is best to open an issue directly on the GitHub repo. Feel free to email if you can't do this however (for example if you don't have a GitHub account)
