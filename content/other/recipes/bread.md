## Bread Maker


Instructions and ingredient order for a Tefal Serie B13 B bread maker

Adapted from [The Improving Cook Recipe](https://www.theimprovingcook.com/2019/08/basic-crusty-white-loaf-for-breadmakers.html), but without the oil or sugar (in my experience the oil and sugar make the bread tast very "cakey")

##### Ingredients

* 500g White Bread Flour/Strong White Flour
* 320g Water
* 1 Tsp Salt
* 1 1/2 Tsp Fast Action Yeast

##### Process

1. Add the water and salk to the bread maker
2. Add the flour, making sure to cover the water
3. Add the yeast on top of the flour, so no yeast is touching the water
4. Place the bread maker pan inside the bread maker
5. Turn the bread maker on and set it to "Plain White Bread"
6. Adjust the crust setting to maximum
7. Set the weight to 750g
8. Optionally, set a timer to start the bread maker later
9. Press start
